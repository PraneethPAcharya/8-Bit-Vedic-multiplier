## Results and Analysis
RTL schematic generated after elaboration shows the complete datapath of the 8-bit Vedic multiplier, including base selection modules, subtractors, barrel shifters, adders, and multiplier blocks interconnected as per the proposed architecture.

### RTL Schematic
Elaborated RTL schematic confirms correct integration of all functional blocks in the Vedic multiplier architecture.

### Resource Utilization
Resource utilization shows that the design uses 186 LUTs with no flip-flops, BRAMs, or DSP blocks, confirming a fully combinational and logic-efficient implementation.
